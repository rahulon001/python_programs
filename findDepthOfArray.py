"""
Write a function that takes in a "special" array and returns its product sum. A "special" array is a non-empty array that
 contains either integers or other "special" arrays. The product sum of a "special" array is the sum of its elements,
  where "special" arrays inside it should be summed themselves and then multiplied by their level of depth. For example,
  the product sum of [x, y] is x + y; the product sum of [x, [y, z]] is x + 2y + 2z.

  Sample input: [5, 2, [7, -1], 3, [6, [-13, 8], 4]]
